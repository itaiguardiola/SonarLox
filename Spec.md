# SonarLox v1.0 — Updated Spec

## Product Vision

A desktop application that lets you visually place multiple audio sources in a 3D room and hear HRTF binaural spatialization in real time through headphones. Load stems from a song, position each in 3D space, and export the result as a single binaural stereo WAV — or load a MIDI file and hear each instrument track spatialized automatically.

## What Changed From the Original MVP Spec

The original MVP was single-source: one audio file, one draggable sphere, one export. Based on the target workflow — splitting a song into parts, positioning them in 3D, and exporting as a single spatial file — v1.0 now includes:

- Multi-source (up to 8 simultaneous sources)
- Global transport with playhead (minimal timeline)
- MIDI file import with auto-split to tracks
- Mixed and per-source binaural export
- Output device selector
- Audio engine abstraction layer (IAudioEngine)
- Visual feedback (distance rings, analyser, front/back cue)
- UI/design polish

The original single-source functionality is preserved as a subset — loading one file and dragging it around still works exactly as before.

---

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Manual Stems

1. User clicks "Add Source" up to 8 times, each time picking a WAV/MP3 file
2. Each source appears as a color-coded sphere in the 3D room
3. All sources share a global transport — play/pause/stop keeps everything in sync
4. User drags each sphere to position instruments in 3D space
5. Per-source controls: volume slider, mute, solo
6. Timeline panel shows waveform per track with a shared playhead
7. Export → single binaural stereo WAV mixing all sources, or per-source WAVs

### Workflow 2: MIDI Import

1. User clicks "Load MIDI" and picks a .mid file
2. SonarLox parses the file, creates one source per track/channel (up to 8)
3. Each source auto-assigned a color and default position (semicircle around listener)
4. Basic synth generates audio per channel (oscillator-based, mapped to GM program numbers)
5. Optionally, user loads a SoundFont (.sf2) for higher quality instrument sounds
6. Same 3D positioning, transport, and export as Workflow 1

### Workflow 3: Single Source (Original MVP)

1. Load one audio file or select a test tone
2. Drag in 3D, hear HRTF spatialization
3. Export as binaural stereo WAV

All three workflows share the same underlying multi-source engine. Workflow 3 is just Workflow 1 with one source.

## Multi-Source Audio Engine

### Architecture

Each source gets its own audio processing chain, all feeding into a shared output:

```
Source 1: AudioBuffer → GainNode(1) → PannerNode(1, HRTF) ─┐
Source 2: AudioBuffer → GainNode(2) → PannerNode(2, HRTF) ─┤
Source 3: AudioBuffer → GainNode(3) → PannerNode(3, HRTF) ─┼──► MasterGain → AnalyserNode → destination
  ...                                                        │
Source 8: AudioBuffer → GainNode(8) → PannerNode(8, HRTF) ─┘
```

All sources share a single `AudioContext`. Each source has:
- Its own `AudioBufferSourceNode` (or oscillator for MIDI/test tones)
- Its own `GainNode` for per-source volume and mute
- Its own `PannerNode` with HRTF for independent spatial positioning
- A unique color for visual identification

### Source Data Model

```typescript
interface AudioSource {
  id: string                          // Unique identifier (uuid or incrementing)
  name: string                        // Display name ("Vocals", "Track 3", "Sine 440Hz")
  color: string                       // Hex color for sphere and UI
  position: [number, number, number]  // [x, y, z] in room units
  volume: number                      // 0.0 to 1.0
  isMuted: boolean
  isSoloed: boolean
  type: 'file' | 'test-tone' | 'midi-track'
  // Internal — not exposed to UI
  buffer: AudioBuffer | null          // Decoded audio data
  sourceNode: AudioBufferSourceNode | OscillatorNode | null
  gainNode: GainNode | null
  pannerNode: PannerNode | null
}
```

### Source Limit

Maximum 8 simultaneous sources. This balances:
- Performance: 8 HRTF PannerNodes is comfortable on modern hardware
- Usability: 8 spheres in a 20x20 room is manageable without layer/visibility UI
- Practicality: covers most stem separation outputs (4-6 tracks) plus extras

### Solo/Mute Logic

Standard DAW behavior:
- **Mute**: silences that source (GainNode → 0). Independent of solo.
- **Solo**: when any source is soloed, only soloed sources play. Multiple sources can be soloed simultaneously. Muted sources stay muted even if soloed.
- Implementation: if any source has `isSoloed: true`, all non-soloed sources are silenced. A source that is both soloed and muted remains silent.

### Default Colors

Pre-assigned color palette for up to 8 sources:
```
#FF6622  (orange)     — Source 1
#22AAFF  (blue)       — Source 2
#44DD66  (green)      — Source 3
#FF44AA  (pink)       — Source 4
#FFCC22  (yellow)     — Source 5
#AA66FF  (purple)     — Source 6
#44FFDD  (cyan)       — Source 7
#FF4444  (red)        — Source 8
```

### Default Positions

When multiple sources are added, spread them in a semicircle in front of the listener at distance 3, Y=1:

```
Source count → positions (looking down, listener at origin facing -Z):

1 source:  [0, 1, -3]  (directly ahead)
2 sources: [-2, 1, -3], [2, 1, -3]
3 sources: [-3, 1, -2], [0, 1, -3], [3, 1, -2]
4+ sources: evenly spaced on a 120° arc, radius 3, centered on -Z
```

---

## Global Transport

### Requirements

- Single play/pause/stop that controls all sources simultaneously
- All sources start at the same `AudioContext.currentTime` to maintain sample-accurate sync
- Playhead position tracked in seconds from start
- Loop toggle: when enabled, all sources loop back to 0 when the longest source ends

### Implementation Notes

- On play: iterate all sources, create and start their `AudioBufferSourceNode`s at the same `context.currentTime`
- On pause: `AudioContext.suspend()` — freezes everything in place
- On resume: `AudioContext.resume()`
- On stop: stop all source nodes, reset playhead to 0
- Playhead position: `context.currentTime - transportStartTime`

### Transport State in Store

```typescript
interface TransportState {
  isPlaying: boolean
  isPaused: boolean
  playheadPosition: number    // seconds from start
  duration: number            // length of longest source
  isLooping: boolean
}
```

---

## Timeline Panel

### Scope for v1

The timeline is minimal — a transport scrubber with per-source waveform visualization. No keyframing, no automation, no position animation. Sources have static positions during playback and export.

### What it shows

- Horizontal timeline bar spanning the duration of the longest source
- Playhead indicator (vertical line) showing current position
- Click/drag on timeline to scrub playhead position
- Per-source rows, each showing:
  - Color swatch matching the source sphere
  - Source name
  - Waveform overview (rendered from AudioBuffer data)
  - Mute/solo buttons inline
- Shorter sources show their waveform left-aligned with empty space after

### Layout

The timeline panel sits below the 3D viewport, with the control panel remaining as a sidebar:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┐
│                                 │              │
│          3D Viewport            │   Control    │
│                                 │   Panel      │
│                                 │              │
├─────────────────────────────────┤              │
│        Timeline Panel           │              │
│  [▶ ⏸ ⏹ 🔁]  ──●───────────── │              │
│  🟠 Vocals   ▁▃▅▇▅▃▁▃▅▇▅▃▁   │              │
│  🔵 Drums    ▇▁▇▁▇▁▇▁▇▁▇▁▇   │              │
│  🟢 Bass     ▃▃▅▅▃▃▅▅▃▃▅▅▃   │              │
└─────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Future (Phase 15)

- Keyframeable source positions over time (see Phase 15 spec below)
- Position curves visualized on timeline automation lanes
- Recording mode: drag source during playback to auto-create keyframes
- Per-source automation lanes (volume, etc. — v2+)

---

## MIDI Support

### Parsing

Use a JavaScript MIDI parser library (e.g., `midi-parser-js`, `@tonejs/midi`, or `midi-file`). Extract:
- Track names (if present in meta events)
- Channel assignments
- Program change events (GM instrument number)
- Note events (note on/off, velocity, timing)

### Track → Source Mapping

Each MIDI track with note data becomes an AudioSource:
- Name: track name from MIDI metadata, or "Track N" / GM instrument name
- Color: from default palette
- Position: default semicircle layout
- Audio: generated by the synth engine

Combine tracks on the same channel into one source. Skip empty tracks. Cap at 8 sources — if the MIDI file has more, take the 8 tracks with the most note events.

### Basic Synth (Default)

Each MIDI channel gets a Web Audio oscillator-based synth:
- Map GM program numbers to basic waveforms and envelope settings
- Piano/keys → triangle wave with moderate attack/release
- Bass → sine/triangle wave, low octave
- Strings/pads → sawtooth with slow attack, long release
- Drums (channel 10) → noise bursts with short envelopes, pitched for different drums
- Everything else → square or sawtooth with default envelope

This won't sound great, but it's functional and zero-dependency. Good enough to demonstrate spatial positioning.

### SoundFont Support (Optional)

User can load a .sf2 SoundFont file for realistic instrument rendering:
- Parse .sf2 using a library like `sf2-parser` or `soundfont-player`
- Map GM program numbers to SoundFont presets
- Render notes using sampled instruments from the SoundFont
- Much higher audio quality, but requires user to provide a .sf2 file

Bundle a small GM SoundFont (~30MB) as an optional download, not included in the app binary.

### MIDI Rendering to AudioBuffers

Before playback, render each MIDI track to an `AudioBuffer`:
1. Parse MIDI → note events per track
2. For each track, use the synth (basic or SoundFont) to render all notes into a buffer
3. Store the buffer as the source's `AudioBuffer`
4. From this point, the MIDI sources behave identically to file-loaded sources

This pre-rendering approach means MIDI playback uses the same engine as WAV/MP3 — no special real-time MIDI scheduling needed.

---

## Export

### Mixed Stereo WAV (Primary)

All sources rendered through their respective HRTF PannerNodes, mixed into one stereo WAV:

1. Create an `OfflineAudioContext` (44.1kHz, stereo, duration = longest source)
2. Set `offlineCtx.listener.positionY.value` to the current listener height
3. For each source, create:
   - `AudioBufferSourceNode` with the source's buffer
   - `GainNode` with the source's volume (respect mute and solo — export matches playback)
   - `PannerNode` with HRTF at the source's position
4. Connect all chains to the offline context destination
5. Start all sources at time 0
6. `offlineCtx.startRendering()` → get the mixed `AudioBuffer`
7. Convert to 44.1kHz 16-bit stereo WAV
8. Electron save dialog → write to disk

**Solo and export:** Export respects the current solo state. When one or more sources are soloed, only soloed (and non-muted) sources are included in the export. This ensures the exported file matches what the user hears during playback.

### Per-Source Export

Export each source as its own spatialized WAV:

1. User selects an output directory via directory picker
2. For each exportable source, create a separate `OfflineAudioContext`
3. Render that single source through its PannerNode (binaural) or VBAP gains (5.1)
4. Save as `{label} - {audioFileName}.wav` (or `_51.wav` suffix for 5.1)
5. Files written directly to chosen directory via IPC (no per-file save dialog)
6. Filenames are sanitized to remove path separators and OS-invalid characters

### Export UI

The "Export..." button in the control panel opens `ExportDialog.tsx` with:
- Export type radio: "Full Mix" / "Individual Stems"
- Rendering mode radio: "Binaural (Stereo)" / "5.1 Surround" / "Both"
- Progress bar during rendering (indeterminate for single jobs, percentage for multi-job)
- Cancel button (stops remaining jobs; current render completes)

For full mix: save dialog per file (or two sequential dialogs for "Both").
For individual stems: directory picker first, then batch render with progress.

Export state (`isExporting`, `exportProgress`) lives in `useAppStore` so the control panel button reflects status even when the dialog is open.

## Visual Feedback

### Distance Rings

Torus geometries emanating from each source, showing distance to listener:
- Ring radius increases with distance
- Ring opacity decreases with distance
- Color matches the source's assigned color
- Update in real time as source is dragged

### Audio Visualizer

Per-source frequency/waveform display:
- Small FFT bar display rendered as a billboard near each source sphere
- Source sphere scales/pulses with amplitude
- Uses `AnalyserSnapshot` from the engine (plain arrays, not AnalyserNode)

### Front/Back Visual Cue

Help the user understand spatial orientation:
- Listener mesh shows a clear facing direction (cone or wedge extending in -Z direction)
- Source sphere color shifts slightly when behind the listener (e.g., cooler tint)
- Optional: ground-plane direction line from listener to source

---

## Rendering Modes

SonarLox supports multiple spatial rendering modes. The user selects the active mode, which determines how virtual source positions are converted to speaker output.

### Mode 1: Binaural Stereo (Default)

- HRTF PannerNode per source → stereo output
- Designed for headphones
- 2-channel output
- This is the existing MVP behavior

### Mode 2: 5.1 Surround

- Channel-based panning per source → 6-channel output
- Designed for 5.1 speaker systems (e.g., Sound Blaster Z SE with discrete outputs)
- Bypasses PannerNode entirely — uses custom gain calculations per channel
- Standard ITU-R BS.775 speaker layout assumed:

```
            Center (0°)
              ╱   ╲
    Front L (30°L)  Front R (30°R)
          │         │
          │ LISTENER│
          │         │
  Surround L (110°L)  Surround R (110°R)

  LFE: omnidirectional, receives low-passed mix (<120Hz)
```

#### 5.1 Panning Algorithm

For each virtual source, compute the angle from the listener to the source on the horizontal plane, then distribute gain across the nearest speaker pair:

```typescript
interface ChannelGains {
  frontLeft: number      // 0.0 – 1.0
  center: number
  frontRight: number
  surroundLeft: number
  surroundRight: number
  lfe: number            // Low-pass filtered, constant ~0.5 for bass content
}

function computeChannelGains(
  sourceX: number,
  sourceZ: number,
  distance: number
): ChannelGains {
  // 1. Compute angle from listener to source (atan2)
  // 2. Find the two nearest speakers flanking that angle
  // 3. Distribute gain between them using sine/cosine panning law
  // 4. Apply distance attenuation
  // 5. LFE gets a low-passed copy at reduced level
}
```

The gain computation runs every frame in the AudioBridge, same as PannerNode position updates in binaural mode.

#### 5.1 Audio Graph

```
Source 1 → GainNode(1) → ChannelSplitter ──┐
Source 2 → GainNode(2) → ChannelSplitter ──┤
  ...                                       ├──► ChannelMergerNode (6ch) → destination
Source 8 → GainNode(8) → ChannelSplitter ──┘

Each source's signal is duplicated to 6 channels with per-channel gain
applied based on VBAP panning coefficients.
```

Implementation: use `AudioContext` with `destination.channelCount = 6`. Each source feeds into a `ChannelSplitterNode` / `GainNode` array (one per output channel), then all merge via a `ChannelMergerNode` connected to the destination. The per-channel gains are updated every frame based on the source's 3D position.

#### 5.1 Audio Device

The Sound Blaster Z SE (PCIe) presents as a multi-channel audio device to the OS. On Windows, it exposes 5.1 output through WASAPI. Chromium's Web Audio API should be able to open a 6-channel AudioContext targeting this device via `sinkId` + `channelCount: 6` on the destination node.

**Verification needed:** Before building the full 5.1 renderer, run a proof-of-concept:
1. Create an `AudioContext` targeting the Sound Blaster device
2. Set `context.destination.channelCount = 6`
3. Create a 6-channel buffer, put a tone on only channel 4 (surround left)
4. Play it — should come out of only the surround left speaker
5. If this works, the approach is valid

### Mode 3: Dolby Atmos (Future — v2+)

- Object-based audio: each source is an "audio object" with position metadata
- Height channels (7.1.4 layout adds 4 overhead speakers)
- Requires Dolby Atmos renderer SDK or encoding to Dolby Digital Plus / TrueHD
- Export as Atmos ADM BWF (Broadcast Wave Format with Audio Definition Model metadata)
- Not implemented in v1, but the data model supports it — source positions in full 3D (X/Y/Z) already include height

### Rendering Mode Selector

UI: dropdown in the Control Panel under OUTPUT section:

```
─── OUTPUT ───
Mode: [Binaural ▾]     ← options: Binaural, 5.1 Surround
Device: [HyperX ▾]     ← filtered to show compatible devices for selected mode
Master Vol: ━━━●━━━
```

When mode is "5.1 Surround," the device dropdown filters to show only multi-channel devices. When mode is "Binaural," it shows all stereo+ devices.

### Export Formats by Mode

| Rendering Mode | Export Format | Channels | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binaural | Stereo WAV | 2 | HRTF-processed, for headphone playback |
| 5.1 Surround | 5.1 WAV | 6 | Channel-based, for surround speaker playback |
| Both | Stereo + 5.1 WAVs | 2 + 6 | Two files exported simultaneously |

The 5.1 WAV export uses standard channel ordering: FL, FR, C, LFE, SL, SR (per WAV/SMPTE convention).

Per-source export also respects the rendering mode — each source exported as a 2-channel (binaural) or 6-channel (5.1) WAV depending on the active mode.

---

## Output Device Selector

From `AUDIO_ENGINE_SPEC.md`:
- Dropdown in control panel listing available audio output devices
- Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` filtered to `audiooutput`
- Selected device applied via `AudioContext.setSinkId()`
- Listens for `devicechange` events (USB hot-plug)
- Persisted preference via electron-store

---

## Control Panel (Updated)

The sidebar control panel now manages multiple sources:

```

### Source Selection

- Click a source in the control panel or click its sphere in the 3D viewport to select it
- Selected source shows position readout and is highlighted in the 3D scene
- Only the selected source is draggable (prevents accidental moves)
- Keyboard shortcut: 1-8 to select source by index, Delete to remove selected

## Updated Zustand Store

The store evolves from single-source to multi-source:

```typescript
interface AppState {
  // Sources
  sources: AudioSource[]
  selectedSourceId: string | null
  addSource: (source: Partial<AudioSource>) => void
  removeSource: (id: string) => void
  updateSource: (id: string, updates: Partial<AudioSource>) => void
  setSelectedSourceId: (id: string | null) => void

  // Output
  selectedOutputDevice: string | null
  masterVolume: number
  setSelectedOutputDevice: (id: string | null) => void
  setMasterVolume: (volume: number) => void
}

interface TransportState {
  isPlaying: boolean
  isPaused: boolean
  playheadPosition: number
  duration: number
  isLooping: boolean
  play: () => void
  pause: () => void
  stop: () => void
  seek: (position: number) => void
  toggleLoop: () => void
}
```

## Implementation Phases (Updated)

### Phase 7: Audio Engine Refactor (Est. 1 session) — CLOUD
- Create IAudioEngine.ts interface
- Rename AudioEngine.ts → WebAudioEngine.ts
- Implement multi-source audio graph (per-source gain + panner chains)
- getAnalyserData() returns plain arrays
- Add device enumeration and selection
- Verify: existing single-source workflow still works

### Phase 8: Multi-Source UI (Est. 2 sessions) — LOCAL
- Update Zustand store for multi-source state

### Phase 10: MIDI Support (Est. 2 sessions) — LOCAL
- MidiParser.ts: parse .mid files, extract tracks/channels/notes
- MidiSynth.ts: basic oscillator synth with GM program mapping
- Render MIDI tracks to AudioBuffers (pre-render, not real-time)
- "Load MIDI" button creates sources from parsed tracks
- Verify: load a MIDI file, hear all tracks spatialized, sounds recognizable

### Phase 11: SoundFont Support (Est. 1 session) — LOCAL
- SoundFontPlayer.ts: parse .sf2, render notes using sampled instruments
- UI: "Load SoundFont" button, indicator showing loaded font name
- Falls back to basic synth if no SoundFont loaded
- Verify: load MIDI + SoundFont, quality noticeably better than basic synth

### Phase 12: Export Dialog + 5.1 Export (COMPLETE)
- ExportDialog component with type/mode radios, progress bar, cancel
- Export respects solo/mute state (matches playback behavior)
- Listener Y position captured in offline render
- 5.1 surround export via VBAP panning to ITU speaker layout
- Binaural, 5.1, or both export modes for mix and per-source
- Directory picker + batch save for stem export (sanitized filenames)
- Path traversal protection in IPC handler
- Verify: export mixed WAV, play in external player, hear all sources spatialized

### Phase 13: Visual Feedback (Est. 1-2 sessions) — LOCAL
- Distance rings per source (color-coded)
- Per-source FFT/amplitude visualization on sphere
- Listener facing direction indicator (cone/wedge)
- Front/back color shift on source spheres
- Verify: visual feedback reacts to audio, facing direction is clear

### Phase 13b: 5.1 Surround Rendering (Est. 2 sessions) — CLOUD + LOCAL
- CLOUD: 5.1 channel panning algorithm (VBAP with ITU speaker positions)
- LOCAL: Proof-of-concept: 6-channel AudioContext → Sound Blaster Z SE, per-channel test tone
- LOCAL: Implement channel gain computation per source per frame
- LOCAL: ChannelSplitter/Merger audio graph for 5.1 output
- LOCAL: Rendering mode selector UI in control panel
- LOCAL: Update Exporter for 6-channel WAV export
- LOCAL: Device dropdown filters by channel capability
- Verify: drag source around room, hear it move across 5.1 speakers correctly

### Phase 14: UI/Design Polish (COMPLETE)
- CSS variables for theme (colors, spacing, typography)
- Consistent component styling (buttons, sliders, dropdowns)
- Hover/active/disabled states
- Layout refinement (viewport/timeline/panel proportions)
- Device selector dropdown
- Keyboard shortcuts (1-8 select source, Delete remove, Space play/pause)
- Toast notification system (console-styled status strips with LED, drain bar)
- Tooltips on all interactive elements with shortcut hints
- Window min size constraints (800x500)
- Confirmation dialogs via native OS dialogs (delete source, unsaved changes)
- Error handling (invalid files, unsupported formats, audio context resume)
- App icon and window title

### Phase 15: Keyframed Position Animation (COMPLETE)

Animate source positions over time. During playback and export, sources move along authored paths instead of staying static.

#### Data Model

```typescript
interface Keyframe {
  time: number              // seconds from start
  position: SourcePosition  // [x, y, z]
  easing: 'linear' | 'ease-in' | 'ease-out' | 'ease-in-out'
}

interface SourceAnimation {
  sourceId: SourceId
  keyframes: Keyframe[]     // sorted by time, minimum 0 (initial position)
}

// Added to AppState
interface AppState {
  animations: Map<SourceId, SourceAnimation>
  isRecordingKeyframes: boolean
  setKeyframe: (sourceId: SourceId, time: number, position: SourcePosition) => void
  removeKeyframe: (sourceId: SourceId, time: number) => void
  clearAnimation: (sourceId: SourceId) => void
}
```

#### Interpolation Engine

New file: `src/renderer/audio/AnimationEngine.ts`

- `getAnimatedPosition(sourceId, time)` — returns interpolated [x, y, z] for a given time
- Uses cubic hermite or catmull-rom spline for smooth curves between keyframes
- Falls back to source's static position when no keyframes exist
- Called by AudioBridge in useFrame during playback (replaces static getState() position read)
- Called by Exporter at render-time sample intervals for export

#### Timeline UI Additions

Updates to `TimelinePanel.tsx`:

- Each source row gains an expandable "automation lane" below the waveform
- Lane shows keyframe diamonds on a horizontal axis matching the timeline scale
- Click on the lane to add a keyframe at that time (captures current source position)
- Drag keyframes left/right to retime, up/down does nothing (position set by 3D drag)
- Right-click keyframe for context menu: delete, change easing
- Selected keyframe shows position readout and easing selector in ControlPanel
- Color-coded path preview: thin line on the 3D ground plane showing the motion path

#### Recording Mode

- "Record" toggle button in transport section (red dot indicator)
- When enabled + playing, any source drag auto-creates keyframes at the current playhead time
- Quantize option: snap keyframes to nearest 0.1s or 0.25s to avoid micro-jitter
- When disabled, drags update position normally (no keyframes created)

#### Playback Integration

- AudioBridge.tsx: during playback, if source has keyframes, read interpolated position instead of store position
- Mesh position in SoundSource.tsx also follows animated position during playback
- When stopped/paused and user drags source, static position updates as before
- Scrubbing the playhead updates source positions to their interpolated values at that time

#### Export Integration

- CLOUD: Design the export strategy for animated positions with OfflineAudioContext
- OfflineAudioContext does not have real-time frame callbacks, so position animation must be pre-baked
- Strategy: chunk the render into small time slices (~50ms), update PannerNode positions between slices
  - Alternative: use AudioParam scheduling on PannerNode.positionX/Y/Z with setValueAtTime() for each keyframe
  - AudioParam approach is more accurate and avoids chunking overhead
- `Exporter.ts` reads keyframes and schedules PannerNode.positionX/Y/Z.setValueAtTime() for each interpolated point
- Interpolation resolution: one position update per 20ms (50 updates/sec) for smooth export
- 5.1 export: pre-compute VBAP gains at each time slice, schedule gain changes per channel

#### Project File (.sonarlox)

- `timeline.json` (currently a placeholder `{ version, tracks: [] }`) gains real content:
  ```json
  {
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "animations": {
      "source-uuid-1": {
        "keyframes": [
          { "time": 0, "position": [2, 1, 0], "easing": "linear" },
          { "time": 5.0, "position": [-3, 1, -2], "easing": "ease-in-out" },
          { "time": 10.0, "position": [0, 1, -4], "easing": "linear" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Backward compatible: loading a v1.0 file with empty tracks array still works (no animations)

#### Implementation Order

1. **CLOUD**: Design interpolation engine + export AudioParam scheduling strategy
2. **LOCAL**: Keyframe data model in store + AnimationEngine.ts
3. **LOCAL**: AudioBridge integration (read animated positions during playback)
4. **LOCAL**: Timeline automation lanes (keyframe diamonds, add/remove/drag)
5. **LOCAL**: Recording mode (auto-keyframe on drag during playback)
6. **LOCAL**: 3D motion path preview (ground-plane polyline)
7. **CLOUD**: Export integration (AudioParam scheduling on OfflineAudioContext)
8. **LOCAL**: Project serialization (timeline.json with keyframe data)

#### Verification

- Add 2 keyframes to a source, play, confirm source sphere moves between positions in 3D
- Confirm audio panning follows the animated position (sound moves in headphones)
- Scrub playhead to a keyframe time, confirm source is at correct position
- Export binaural mix with animated source, play in external player, hear movement
- Save project, reopen, confirm keyframes restored and animation plays back correctly
- Record mode: play + drag source, stop, replay, confirm motion replays

### Phase 16: Plugin System (COMPLETE)

Extensible plugin architecture allowing third-party audio processors, visualizers, and exporters.

#### Plugin Types

| Type | Description | Interface |
|---|---|---|
| `audio-effect` | Per-source or master insert effect (reverb, delay, EQ, compressor) | Receives AudioNode input, returns AudioNode output |
| `visualizer` | Custom 3D visualization (particle systems, waveform meshes, etc.) | Receives analyser data + source positions, renders into R3F scene |
| `exporter` | Custom export format (Ambisonic B-format, Atmos ADM BWF, FLAC, etc.) | Receives source buffers + positions, produces output file(s) |
| `source-generator` | Custom audio source (granular synth, ambient noise, AI-generated) | Produces AudioBuffer or streams AudioNode output |

#### Plugin Manifest

Each plugin is a directory with a `plugin.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "id": "com.example.reverb",
  "name": "Convolution Reverb",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "audio-effect",
  "author": "Example Author",
  "description": "Impulse response convolution reverb with wet/dry mix",
  "main": "index.js",
  "ui": "panel.tsx",
  "permissions": ["audio-graph", "file-read"],
  "parameters": [
    { "id": "wet", "type": "float", "min": 0, "max": 1, "default": 0.3, "label": "Wet Mix" },
    { "id": "ir", "type": "file", "extensions": ["wav"], "label": "Impulse Response" }
  ]
}
```

#### Plugin API

```typescript
// Core plugin interface — all plugins implement this
interface SonarLoxPlugin {
  id: string
  activate(context: PluginContext): void | Promise<void>
  deactivate(): void
}

// Context provided to plugins at activation
interface PluginContext {
  audioContext: AudioContext
  getSourcePositions: () => Map<SourceId, SourcePosition>
  getPlayheadTime: () => number
  getParameter: (id: string) => number | string | boolean
  onParameterChange: (id: string, callback: (value: unknown) => void) => void
  log: (message: string) => void
}

// Audio effect plugins
interface AudioEffectPlugin extends SonarLoxPlugin {
  type: 'audio-effect'
  createNode(context: AudioContext): AudioNode  // insert into chain
  connectInput(input: AudioNode): void
  getOutput(): AudioNode
}

// Visualizer plugins
interface VisualizerPlugin extends SonarLoxPlugin {
  type: 'visualizer'
  render(props: {
    sources: Array<{ id: string; position: SourcePosition; analyserData: Float32Array }>
    listenerPosition: SourcePosition
    delta: number
  }): React.ReactNode  // R3F JSX
}

// Exporter plugins
interface ExporterPlugin extends SonarLoxPlugin {
  type: 'exporter'
  export(sources: ExportSource[], options: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
  fileExtension: string
  formatName: string
}
```

#### Plugin Loading

- Plugins directory: `~/.sonarlox/plugins/` (or `%APPDATA%/sonarlox/plugins/` on Windows)
- On app start, scan plugin directories, validate manifests, register available plugins
- Plugins run in a sandboxed iframe or web worker for isolation (audio effects need main thread AudioContext access, so iframe with MessageChannel)
- Plugin manager in main process handles installation/removal via IPC
- No hot-reload in v1 -- restart required after installing/removing plugins

#### Plugin UI

- New "Plugins" section in ControlPanel (below Export, above Camera)
- Lists active plugins with enable/disable toggle per plugin
- Audio effects show insert slot UI: dropdown per source to add effect in chain
- Plugin parameters rendered as sliders/dropdowns based on manifest `parameters` array
- Plugin settings panel opens as a slide-out overlay (similar to ExportDialog)

#### Plugin Store / Installation

- v1: Manual installation only (copy plugin directory to plugins folder)
- v2: Built-in plugin browser fetching from a curated registry (GitHub-based)
- Plugin directory structure:
  ```
  ~/.sonarlox/plugins/
  ├── com.example.reverb/
  │   ├── plugin.json
  │   ├── index.js
  │   └── panel.tsx
  └── com.example.spectrum/
      ├── plugin.json
      └── index.js
  ```

#### Audio Effect Chain Integration

When audio effects are active, the per-source audio graph becomes:

```
Source → GainNode → [Effect1] → [Effect2] → PannerNode(HRTF) → masterGain → destination
```

- Effects insert between GainNode and PannerNode (pre-spatial processing)
- Master effects (post-spatial) insert between masterGain and destination
- Effect order is user-configurable via drag-and-drop in the effect chain UI
- Bypass toggle per effect (reconnects input directly to output)

#### Project Serialization

- Active plugins and their parameter states saved in `state.json` within .sonarlox files:
  ```json
  {
    "plugins": {
      "com.example.reverb": {
        "enabled": true,
        "target": "source-uuid-1",
        "slot": 0,
        "parameters": { "wet": 0.4, "ir": "hall.wav" }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- On project open, warn if required plugin is not installed

#### Implementation Order

1. **CLOUD**: Design plugin API interfaces, sandbox strategy, security model
2. **LOCAL**: Plugin manifest parser + directory scanner
3. **LOCAL**: Plugin manager (load/unload lifecycle, parameter system)
4. **CLOUD**: Audio effect chain integration (insert nodes between gain and panner)
5. **LOCAL**: Plugin UI in ControlPanel (list, enable/disable, parameter controls)
6. **LOCAL**: Visualizer plugin rendering hook (inject into R3F scene)
7. **LOCAL**: Exporter plugin integration (add to ExportDialog format list)
8. **LOCAL**: Example plugins: simple reverb (ConvolverNode), spectrum visualizer
9. **LOCAL**: Project serialization for plugin state

#### Verification

- Install example reverb plugin, enable on a source, hear reverb applied before spatialization
- Disable plugin, reverb stops, audio chain intact
- Install visualizer plugin, see custom visualization in 3D viewport
- Export with effect plugin active, confirm effect is baked into exported WAV
- Save project with plugin parameters, reopen, plugin restores state
- Remove plugin directory, reopen project, graceful warning (not crash)
